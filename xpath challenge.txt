Hi,
Challenges in Xpath:
	Locators are mostly dynamic in ICDD/RTOB, where ID and name property are used minimal.
	Xpath’s are not simple, locators are identified by traversing from one tag to other.

Refer below xpath’s which was used in automation
By.xpath("(//span[text()='Sub-segment']/../../../following-sibling::div//input)");
By.xpath("//table[@class='summaryTabOverview']//td[contains(.,'Risk Level')]/following-sibling::td[1]");
By.xpath("//*[text()='Passport Number:']/../td[7]");
By.xpath("//*[text()='Detection Datetime']/../following-sibling::tr/following-sibling::tr/td[6]");
By.xpath("//table[@id='alertsModel']//tr[" + i + "]/td[" + stepColumnNumber + "]"));

So, to identify an unique xpath is a challenging work.

Best-case:
Simple Xpath’s using className/Tagname/text() can be implemented.
